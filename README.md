# DataViz

This data visualization dashboard is a small project that i created shortly after learning react. In the future, i plan on creating something more sophisticated, and not hard coded. None the less, at this point, im not sure how one would structure the data in the DB and abstract the chart creation in a way that would allow users to upload their own information, for instance.
